**Heart Disease Prediction Analysis Report**
**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze healthcare data and derive insights relevant to heart disease prediction using Power BI. It showcases my skills in data visualization, statistical analysis, and storytelling with data. The report includes several key visuals to identify patterns and trends across various patient characteristics like gender, age, smoking status, and medical history (e.g., conditions like asthma and angina).

**Key Skills Demonstrated**

Data Transformation: Used Power Query to clean, filter, and transform raw data, preparing it for analysis.

Data Visualization: Created various visuals (e.g., bar charts, donut charts, bubble charts) in Power BI to represent complex data clearly.

Analytical Thinking: Employed custom filtering to highlight insights related to heart disease risk factors.

Data Storytelling: Organized the report to guide viewers through a logical flow, from general demographic insights to specific risk factor analysis.

**Project Breakdown**
1. Alcohol Drinker vs. Sex
Visualization: Donut Chart
Purpose: To show the breakdown of alcohol consumption by gender.
Insight: Alcohol consumption patterns by gender help identify lifestyle-related risk factors for heart disease.
2. Patient General Health vs. Sex
Visualization: Stacked Bar Chart
Purpose: To categorize patients' self-reported health status and segment it by gender.
Insight: Helps in understanding how patients perceive their general health, with gender-specific trends.
3. Average BMI vs. Sex & Age Category
Visualization: Bubble Chart
Purpose: To display the trend of BMI values across age categories, split by gender.
Insight: Observes patterns in BMI across different ages, which could relate to heart disease risk.
4. Patient Smoke Status vs. Sex
Visualization: Donut Chart
Purpose: To show the distribution of smoking habits among male and female patients.
Insight: Provides insights into smoking trends across genders, an important factor in heart disease risk.
5. Health Conditions Filters (e.g., Asthma, Angina, Arthritis)
Visualization: Slicer Filters
Purpose: Binary filters to enable analysis based on the presence or absence of specific health conditions.
Insight: Allows for dynamic filtering to analyze correlations between heart disease and other health issues.
6. KPI Card for Patient Count
Visualization: KPI Card
Purpose: Displays the total number of patients in the dataset.
Insight: A quick overview of the data scale.
